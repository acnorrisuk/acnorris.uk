            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Adam Norris and I'm a front-end developer currently working for a digital agency based in Leeds, UK. I am married with two children and enjoy music, table-top gaming and the odd curry.</p>
            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I enjoy building websites which are accessible, performant and have a great user experience. I prefer to focus on what is best for the user rather than this year's latest trend. I use the principles of progressive enhancement to create clean, semantic code which will work across a range of situations.</p>
            <h2>My Toolbox</h2>
            <p>I try to keep things simple and only use tools when they're really needed. Here's some I use on a regular basis:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>WordPress / Craft CMS</li>
            <li>Photoshop / Sketch</li>
            <li>Git / Github / Bitbucket</li>
            <li>Gulp / Codekit</li>
            <li>VS Code</li>
            <li>Deploybot HQ</li>
            <li>Google Analytics / Tag manager</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Find Me</h2>
